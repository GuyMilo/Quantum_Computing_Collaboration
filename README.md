Abstract: Decomposing CFD problems into a linear combination of unitariary matrices (LCU), whose coefficients can be computed using HHL. <br><br> 

#### [[2]](https://github.com/Weidsn/Quantum_Computing_Collaboration/blob/main/A%20hybrid%20quantum-classical%20CFD%20methodology%20with%20benchmark%20HHL%20solutions.pdf) *A Performance Study of Variational Quantum Algorithms for Solving the Poisson Equation on a Quantum Computer* (May 2023)

Abstract: Solving Poisson equations using a variational quantum algorithm (VQA), i.e., Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Results were not promising. VQLS is further discussed in [[5]](https://github.com/Weidsn/Quantum_Computing_Collaboration/blob/main/Variational%20quantum%20linear%20solver.pdf). <br><br>

Abstract: Solving CFD problems by implementing HHL (referred to as Quantum Linear Systems Algorithm) with a discussion of Quantum Postprocessing Protocol (QPP), which concerns information extraction via quantum state measurements. <br><br> 

#### [[4]](https://github.com/Weidsn/Quantum_Computing_Collaboration/blob/main/Variational%20quantum%20algorithm%20for%20the%20Poisson%20equation.pdf) *Variational quantum algorithm for the Poisson equation* (2021)

Abstract: Solving Poisson equations using a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) that reduces the number of quantum measurements required on NISQ computers. <br><br> 

#### [[5]](https://github.com/Weidsn/Quantum_Computing_Collaboration/blob/main/Variational%20quantum%20linear%20solver.pdf) *Variational quantum linear solver* (2023)

Abstract: As parts of a variational quantum algorithm (VQA), introducing the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) to quantify the closeness between $A$ $|x\rangle$ and $|b\rangle$ on NISQ computers.
